# Privacy Policy for AI ThreadStash

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

Thank you for using AI ThreadStash. Your privacy is extremely important to us. This Privacy Policy is intended to be as simple and clear as possible to explain what data we do and do not collect.

## Data We Do Not Collect

The core philosophy of AI ThreadStash (in its current version) is to be a local-first, privacy-respecting tool. We want to be very clear: **AI ThreadStash does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or conversation content to our servers.**

* **No Personal Information:** We do not require you to create an account, so we do not collect any personally identifiable information, such as your name, email address, or user ID.
* **No Conversation Data:** The extension processes the content of AI conversations (e.g., from ChatGPT, DeepSeek) entirely within your local browser. This data is never sent to our servers.
* **No User Activity Tracking:** We do not track your browsing history, clicks, or any other user activity.

## Data That is Stored Locally

AI ThreadStash may use the `chrome.storage.local` API to save your settings, such as your preferred export format. This data is stored only on your own computer and is not accessible by us.

## Future Changes to This Policy

We are actively developing new features for AI ThreadStash, including a future Pro version which will require a user account and offer cloud sync capabilities (e.g., to Notion). When these features are released, we will need to collect some user data (such as an email address for login) to provide these services.

We will update this Privacy Policy accordingly before any such changes take effect. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
